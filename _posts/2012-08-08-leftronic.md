##Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Rajiv Ghanta. I'm the CEO and co-founder of [Leftronic](https://www.leftronic.com/). I played architect in the early days of our company, but am now focused on supporting our existing customers and attracting new ones.

Leftronic is the best way to monitor your key metrics. When you monitor your metrics, your company succeeds. Our dashboards provide visibility into exactly how your company is performing, and help drive the insights needed to make your company flourish.

We launched in early 2012, and we've been rapidly growing since. We're backed by amazing angel investors, and we're proud to call Twilio, Heroku, Compete, HomeAway and many others our customers!

##What is your technology stack?

Our application is built on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) running on [Nginx](http://nginx.com/). We use [Celery](http://celeryproject.org/) and [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/) for periodically retrieving data from the various third party services, as well as for our pull API. We use [Redis](http://redis.io/) for caching and storing our real-time data. Our real-time dashboard updates and push API are handled by [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).

##What software do you use to run your business?

We are hosted on [Rackspace Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/). We use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for our code base, and [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.3/index.html) for managing our deploys.

We love [Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/) for project management, and [Lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com/) for bugs.

We use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) for monitoring our website, and [MixPanel](https://mixpanel.com/) for measuring engagement.

We use [Olark](https://www.olark.com/) (love it!) and [Skype](http://www.skype.com) to interface with our customers. Internally, the team is on [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/) and [Grove.io](https://grove.io/).

We use [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) for managing our mass emails.

We use [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/) for testing across various browsers.

We love [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payment processing.

We use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) for sharing and storing important documents.

We use [MacBook Pros](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) for development, and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for coding.

We use [Perfect Audience](http://perfectaudience.com/) for retargeting.

##What business software do you most wish existed?

Cross-browser and cross-platform testing has a long way to go. Also, we were disappointed with current CRM offerings, so we built our own.
