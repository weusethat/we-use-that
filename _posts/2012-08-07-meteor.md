##Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Nick Martin](http://www.nimlabs.org/). I am a founder at the [Meteor Development Group](http://meteor.com/). My personal responsibilities are wide-ranging. Meteor is an OpenStack web framework for building single page JavaScript applications.

Facebook, Twitter, Google... all these big companies are building web application in a certain way. We aim to bring that style of new application to a much broader community of web developers. We want to make it possible for small teams and individuals to build the sort of rich, responsive and immersive applications that previously have been the domain of big companies with massive resources.

We just raised money from Andreessen Horowitz. It is a big vote of confidence from smart people who agree that we are on the right track. We look forward to working with them and expanding and building out Meteor.

##What is your technology stack?

The basis of our technology stack is [JavaScript](www.mozilla.org/js/). A developer using Meteor would write all of their code in Javascript. Developers only need to use one language. It reduces a lot of friction and makes the whole experience faster and easier to learn.

One important technology we use is web browsers since we are building web applications. We support every browser from IE7 on up.

On the server-side we use [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) as our Javascript engine. Node is awesome, it lets us get stuff done really quickly and is a core part of what we do. Node has lots of packages, we use a number of them including [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/).

We use [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as our database backend. We will have multiple database backends, but we are focusing on building the experience for just the one database first. We actually ship MongoDB with our development bundle. 

We use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) for our version control.

##What software do you use to run your business?

We host everything on Amazon [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), we love it. [MongoHQ](http://mongohq.com/) hosts our Mongo instances, they have been great. We use a company called [ServerDensity](http://www.serverdensity.com/) for server monitoring, they are pretty cool. We also use [PagerDuty](http://www.pagerduty.com/) to get paged when things go down.

For cross-browser testing, we use two different companies, [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/) and [Browserling](https://browserling.com/).

For our metrics and dashboards we use [Leftronic](https://www.leftronic.com/). They do great, pretty dashboards and let us push in our metrics as we go. We use [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) and [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) for site analytics for meteor.com.

For project management we use [Asana](http://asana.com/). We use Asana all the time. It is the way we keep track of everything that is going on in the company. We use it for day to day planning, strategic long term planning, our kitchen supply list.. everything. Most day to day tasks and communication goes through Asana.

Another thing we use a lot is [Hackpad](https://hackpad.com/), a real-time collaborative text editor/wiki thing. Hackpad is really great.

We use an open source tool [Phabricator](http://phabricator.org/) for code reviews internally. It has been great for us so far. We also use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for code reviews so it's sort of a fuzzy process right now, but we are pretty happy with Phabricator.

The Meteor code itself is hosted on GitHub. We  pay for GitHub and have a number of internal repositories, but the main thrust is the public GitHub.

[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is great for handling support. We have a mailing list that is in [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com/). We use [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) a lot, we have a pretty big following and we try to keep up to date with that. We have a public irc channel for support and community, that's on [Freenet](https://freenetproject.org/).

For bug tracking, we mostly use Asana although we also have the externally visible GitHub Issues list.

We use [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) for transactional emails. 

We have [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/) for email. We keep track of all our time on Google Calendar, if you want to have a meeting with someone you just sent them an invite.

We use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) pretty extensively for sharing our files and plans.

Another thing we use as sort of a corporate benefit is a company called [Exec](https://iamexec.com/) for doing random tasks. We use them to go get stuff or take care of things.

The two things we've gotten the most mileage out of are Asana and GitHub. The open source collaboration community just wouldn't be possible without Github, they're doing a great job. Asana has also really saved us a lot of time and effort planning and organizationally it's been really great.


##What business software do you most wish existed?

That is a tough one... One thing that would be really nice is an automated cross-browser testing framework. I know both BrowserBtack and Browserling have started working on the poblem, but that is a legitimately hard problem.

In some sense, if we encounter something that is missing that we really need, we have to build it. It's not like these are purely internal things that just make us go faster. These things are the sorts of things that we expose our users to and are the platforms that will grow with us an our users. So when there's something really missing we have to do it.
