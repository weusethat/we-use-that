## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Nicholas Firth-McCoy](https://streaming.nfm.id.au), one of the founders of [Paydirt](https://paydirtapp.com/). Paydirt is a time-tracking and invoicing web application that makes it simple for freelancers and agencies to keep track of the work they've done, and get paid for it. We also [automate the process of keeping track of your time](https://paydirtapp.com/blog/automate-time-tracking-with-chrome-and-firefox/) with our Chrome and Firefox extensions, which determine who you're working for based on web sites you visit.

## What is your technology stack?

Paydirt is a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) app, with most of the front-end written in [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/). The back-end is pretty standard for Rails: [unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) workers proxied to by [nginx](http://nginx.org/), with a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database, and [Delayed::Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) running background tasks.

We're into HAML, Coffeescript, and SASS. We use the excellent [haml_coffee_assets](https://github.com/netzpirat/haml_coffee_assets) gem for our client-side templates.

Some of the more interesting tech that we're using includes [D3.js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) for graphing, [grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape) to define our API, [faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com/) for pub-sub messaging, and [wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf) to generate PDFs.

## What software do you use to run your business?

We use [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for backups, are hosted on [Slicehost](https://slicehost.net), and use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for code hosting and issues.

[Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com/) handles all our transactional email, and we use [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) for mail campaigns. [KISSmetrics](http://kissmetrics.com) and [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) help us keep track of our metrics. We use [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps/) for mail.

We use [NewRelic](http://newrelic.com) to monitor our performance and uptime, and [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io) to keep track of application errors.

[Spreedly](http://spreedly.com) handles all of our subscription billing.

We store most of our files in [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com).

## What business software do you most wish existed?

It's an age-old problem, and lots of people are working on it, but something to better manage the inbox. Important things get lost, unimportant things get too much attention, and having a constant stream of emails coming in can decimate your productivity.
