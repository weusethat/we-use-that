##Who are you, and what do you do?

I am [Sivamani Varun](http://www.linkedin.com/in/netvarun) and I am one of the co-founders of [Semantics3](https://semantics3.com/). We make APIs for products data.

For >10 million products, we track ~50 metadata fields (brand, size, UPC, features, price histories, etc..)  across several websites, and allow users to run interesting queries on them. One can easily build a shopping comparison site, analyze price trends or even create a search engine for products using our API.

We launched our closed beta a couple of months ago and since then we have been busy working with our customers and ensuring that our API satisfies all their needs. Based on their feedback we have also been adding lots of features and refining existing ones. We will be opening our service to all users very soon. Stay tuned!

##What is your technology stack?

[Perl](http://perl.org/) is our weapon of choice and [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/) is our starting point whenever there is some task that needs to be accomplished. There is a very high chance that someone has already contributed a module to do whatever you are trying to achieve to the CPAN! The other language which use is server-side Javascript, running on top of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Our [API server](http://blog.semantics3.com/building-a-paid-api-offering/) is built on Node using the [Restify](http://mcavage.github.com/node-restify/) framework.

We use [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) for storing all the structured data we extract for the various products. We use [Redis](http://redis.io/) extensively for our in-memory needs. We also use it's pub-sub features to power our internal dashboard.

The search features of our Products API are powered using [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/). We use [Gearman](http://gearman.org/) for our job queue needs.

Our website is built using the [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/) framework. Our internal dashboard is built using the [Dancer](http://perldancer.org/) micro-framework.
On the client side, we use [ICanHaz.js](http://icanhazjs.com/) for our client-side rendering and of course [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) is used extensively.
Some other Javascript libraries which we use include [JQuery Flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/), [JQuery DataTables](http://datatables.net/), [Bootstrap datepicker](https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker), [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) and [SytaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/)
Our website is styled using [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

Our entire platform runs on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com). We use [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for storing all our data,
[CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) for hosting all our static assets, [EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) for persistent storage for our DBs, and of course
[EC2]((https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) - on which we run a [60-node cluster](http://blog.semantics3.com/how-we-built-our-almost-distributed-web-crawler/). Our backend applications (web crawling, disambiguation and data indexing) are designed to work in a stateless manner. As a result we are able to run them on a large number of spot instances, giving us great throughput at very low costs. All our instances run [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/) 12.04.

Our [blog](http://blog.semantics3.com/) is hosted on a shared [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com/) server running [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/).

##What software do you use to run your business?

We use [git](http://git-scm.com/) for our code versioning. We use [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) for the provisioning of our servers and
[Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) for the deployment of our git repositories to all our distributed cluster. Our git repositories are hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/).
We are planning on using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) for sandbox development. For transaction email needs, we use [Amazon SES](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/).

We use [Monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/) for monitoring our scripts, [logrotate](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html) for managing our log files and
[Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) for daemonizing our processes. I am currently in the process of setting up a centralized logging server using [Logstash](http://logstash.net/).

[Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps) is the cornerstone on which our company communicates. I can go on raving about Google Apps :) We use [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) extensively
for collaborative editing and all our business documents are stored on our [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/). We practically live on [GMail](http://gmail.com/). We use
[Chat](http://gmail.com/) a lot for buzzing our colleagues. Another great piece of software which we use is [Rapportive](http://rapportive.com/). This is a great tool that gives me lots of deatils (Full name, LinkedIn profile, etc..) about all my mail senders and recipients.

We tried using [Do.com](http://do.com/) for project/task managment, but somehow we just kept going back to email and our whiteboard. I have come to the conclusion that for a 4-person startup task management tools are probably a little overkill. I personally use GMail Tasks for handling my to-do lists.

For handling payments we use [PayPal](https://paypal.com/), though it was really painful to setup.

We use [UserVoice](http://uservoice.com/) for handling feedback and support. We are thinking of signing up for [Zopim](http://zopim.com/) for live chat and [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) for
handling our newsletters. For our website analytics we use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/).

For backup and internal sharing of our business documents, we use [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com). This is actually our third layer of storage. There is usually a copy in our inbox and another one on
Google Drive. Paranoid about our data, we are :)

##What business software do you most wish existed?

CRM software blended with [Rapportive](http://rapportive.com/), along with the features of task/project management tools like [Trello](http://trello.com) and [Asana](http://asana.com/), baked into [GMail](http://gmail.com/) would be great!

Since I pretty much live on [GMail](http://gmail.com/), business tools neatly integrated onto it would be a great timesaver. I just dislike the idea of using another piece of software to achieve some task, which could very well be done on GMail itself.
