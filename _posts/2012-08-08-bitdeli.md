##Who are you, and what do you do?

I am [Ville Tuulos](https://github.com/tuulos/). I co-founded [Bitdeli](https://bitdeli.com) with my brother
[Jyri Tuulos](https://twitter.com/jtuulos). We want to democratize analytics by providing a fun and productive
environment for sharing and building scripts that measure your business.

We admire applications that look and feel amazingly simple and yet are super powerful under the hood.
This is our guiding principle for Bitdeli.

After 6 months of busy hacking, we launched the first version of Bitdeli in February 2012. Thanks to great
feedback we have been getting since the launch, we will be releasing a big update this fall. Stay tuned!

##What is your technology stack?

Bitdeli is powered by the combination of [Erlang](http://erlang.org) and [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com).
Erlang itself is one of those things that is at the same time simple and amazingly powerful. It is designed for building
highly-available distributed systems, i.e the backbone of your infrastructure. For that purpose it works better than anything
else. For non-concurrent components, we use [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)),
[Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)),
and have them supervised by Erlang.

Bitdeli is designed to be a native citizen of public clouds like [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com). It is surprisingly different to
design a data-intensive system specifically for the cloud compared to dedicated hardware. After hacking
[Disco](http://discoproject.org), an open-source implementation MapReduce, for over three years and now Bitdeli, [this
topic is becoming close to my heart](http://vimeo.com/43169887).

One of the biggest benefits of this approach is that the system can mostly deploy itself automatically based on the actual
load. Instead of using a service like [Auto Scaling](http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) at AWS, we manage the process in
our own Erlang code with a little help from [Boto](https://github.com/boto/boto). It is not turtles all the way down though.
At the very bottom we are using [Fabric](http://fabfile.org) to bootstrap the environment.

On the client side, Jyri is an eager user of [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) and [JQuery](http://jquery.com). For
visualizations, we have been going back and forth but currently we are happy with [D3](http://d3js.org). The new version
of Bitdeli will be using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) although we try to avoid making it too
obvious.

##What software do you use to run your business?

Our code lives in several [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repositories, some of which are hosted at [GitHub](http://github.com/bitdeli/).
Based on my earlier expriences, it is super important to agree on a common workflow for Git right from the start. To keep
things simple, we decided to follow this [well known branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and
these [simple guidelines for commit messages](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages).

[Rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar/) is an excellent build tool for Erlang which also does great job in managing
dependencies using Git. In addition to Rebar, [http://basho.com](Basho) has contributed a whole bunch of [useful, high-quality
libraries for Erlang](https://github.com/basho) - thanks Basho!

Regarding human-to-human communication, we rely on [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/) (mostly Gmail),
[Flowdock](http://flowdock.com) and [Trello](http://trello.com). I had hard time believing that any chat service could beat IRC
but I have become addicted to tags, attachments and search in Flowdock. Trello works well for seeing the big picture with one glimpse.

We use [Pingdom](http://pingdom.com) to monitor our infrastructure and [Olark](http://olark.com) to chat with our users.
Our mailing list is managed by [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) - they are also our golden standard when it comes to
any user-facing communication. Emails sent by the system are handled by [MailGun](http://mailgun.com). We take a look
at their documentation or [Stripe](https://stripe.com) when we need an example of a beautiful and developer-friendly API.

For backup and storage, we use both [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and [Rsync.net](http://rsync.net). Rsync.net provides
a stable and no-nonsense storage service, which most importantly is independent from Amazon. Don't put all eggs
in one cloud. For the same reason some of our non-elastic servers are hosted by [Linode](http://linode.com).

##What business software do you most wish existed?

Someone should create a service that provided a real-time benchmark over all cloud and VPS
providers. Naturally it would need to be fully automated, as the environment is constantly evolving.

I wouldn't mind if they
acted as a broker, dealing us cheapest available computing capacity from any provider given our requirements at any
point of time.
