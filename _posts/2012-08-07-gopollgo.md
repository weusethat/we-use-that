##Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Ben Schaechter](https://twitter.com/bensign) and I'm a founder and developer at [GoPollGo](http://GoPollGo.com).  GoPollGo is a great way to run polls and get responses back from people in real-time.  We also give users the ability to segment votes by age, gender, location, and a bunch of other dimensions.  Some of our users include TechCrunch, Netflix, ESPN, and Yahoo.  GoPollGo's main product is a web app, but we've also got a sweet mobile web version. Also, an iOS app is on the way.

##What is your technology stack?

All of our servers run on [The RackSpace Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/) and all assets live on [RackSpace Cloud Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/files/).  The majority of our application logic is written in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and all of our data is persisted to disk in [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).  We use [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) for all real-time communications with the browser.  [Redis](http://redis.io/) is used for pub/sub, messaging between various services, and as a hot-cache for certain data.  

We have to deal with unpredictable, sudden bursts of traffic and have found [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) to be incredibly helpful as a HTTP reverse-proxy server which sits in front of all of our application servers.  We process various background jobs with [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque/).

Our front end is organized with [BackBone.js](http://backbonejs.org/).  Our real-time animating charts and maps are built on top of [Raphaël.js](http://raphaeljs.com/).  We're big fans of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), as well.

We've done a lot of customization with [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/) deployment hooks to run our suite of unit and functional tests, compress and minify all assets (JavaScript, CSS, image sprites, etc.) as well as push them to the CDN, restart background workers and various servers if necessary.  We use [Phusion Passenger](http://www.modrails.com/) as an application server and [NGINX](http://nginx.com/) as a web server.

##What software do you use to run your business?

Our team lives on [Github](http://github.com) and [HipChat](http://hipchat.com).  We also have them hooked up together so all commits, pull requests, comments and issues are thrown directly in our chat logs for us to discuss or reference.  We use Github Issues for all issue tracking and feature requests.  Pull Requests are code reviews.  We occassionally use [Trello](https://trello.com/) for longer todo type tasks or projects.  We use [Airbrake](www.airbrake.io) for error reporting and [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) for application monitoring to make sure all pages are loading quickly.

We use [Pingdom](http://www.pingdom.com/) to monitor all of our production servers.  [Monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/) is set up to monitor all services and restart them if memory bloat or extreme CPU usage spikes occur.  We also keep an eye on various systems with [Munin](http://munin-monitoring.org/) to make sure everything is running smoothly.  Every developer also has a set of rake/cap tasks at his/her disposal to remotely restart services if necessary.

We've found [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/) to be pretty cool to all hop on a quick conference call when people are working remote.  

##What business software do you most wish existed?

Our payroll service is probably the worst interface I've ever experienced.  To do anything is a big hassle.  Improving the UI alone could monumentally improve the product.  There is also a lot of room for improvement for error reporting and tracking.  Finally, we love HipChat, but their iOS app is fairly sluggish and could use a bit of performance improvement.
